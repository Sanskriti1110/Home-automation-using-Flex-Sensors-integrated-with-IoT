# Home-automation-using-Flex-Sensors-integrated-with-IoT

The paralytic society or the community often have to be dependent upon others for performing even the most basic activities of a day to day life such as switching on the lights and fans or unlocking the door. Our goal is to design and develop a Flex sensor + IoT integrated glove that detects the movements or the gestures made by the patient to perform certain activities keeping all the safety measures and emergency situations in mind.
